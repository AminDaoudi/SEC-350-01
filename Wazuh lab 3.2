Comprehensive guide to installing and configuring Wazuh SIEM tool.
Firstly, on you wazuh (ubuntu) server, run the command "curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.3/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a -i"  
or
sudo wget https://packages.wazuh.com/4.3/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a -i   (if the first command doesn't work)

After the installation, WAZUH will provide you with a username and password. (REMEMBER THOSE)
After that, WAZUH should be running and are able to access it via chrome.  
Type in the URL"https://172.16.200.10    
Then it will prompt you with a log in page. 
Type in the username and password it provided for you when installing WAZUH
Then go to "Add agent" tab and fill in each step: 
1. Redhat/CentoS
2. CentOS 6 or higher (Note, it will work on rocky 8)
3. x86_64
4. 172.16.200.10
5. default
6. This will give you the syntax for a command that you can run on Web01 to install the agent
7. Run the command on your web01 server
The command should look something like this on the bottom of the page

sudo WAZUH_MANAGER='172.16.200.10' WAZUH_AGENT_GROUP='default' yum install https://package.wazuh.com/4.x/yum/wazuh-agent-4.3.11-1.x86_64.rpm

8. Use the systemctl commands provided by Wazuh to Start the Wazuh agent on web01
Once that is installed on your WEB01 page type these commands:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable wazuh-agent
sudo systemctl start wazuh-agent
sudo systemctl status wazuh-agent  (make sure it shows successful when this command is run.)

how refresh the page and web01-yourname should be shown on wazuh. 
Now to test wazuh's security events, try sshing into 172.16.50.2 with and invalid user/password
Once that is done, you should be able to see on wazuh that someone was trying to ssh into web01.
